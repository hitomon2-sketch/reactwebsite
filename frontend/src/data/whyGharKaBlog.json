  "intro": "In every Indian home, food is more than a meal — it is a memory. A moment. A feeling of comfort, care, and warmth. At GHAR KA, we don’t just make products… we recreate the emotional experience of home-style cooking, using traditional methods and honest ingredients. This is the story behind our difference.",

      "heading": "Where Everything Begins — The Home Kitchen",
      "paragraph": "Before a single jar is packed or a label is printed, the journey begins with the most authentic kitchen of all: a simple Indian home. Every recipe comes from mothers, grandmothers, and families who have perfected their craft over decades. There are no factories, no industrial shortcuts — just real people making real food."

    {
      "heading": "No Preservatives, No Tricks — Only Purity",
      "paragraph": "In a world full of adulteration and artificial flavors, staying honest is our biggest strength. We choose ingredients the way a careful parent does — checking their smell, texture, and freshness. Each batch is slow-cooked, sun-dried, or naturally preserved, so you receive food exactly as nature intended."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Recipes Passed Down Like Stories",
      "paragraph": "Every product carries a story. A spice mix perfected by a grandmother. A pickle recipe protected by a mother. A ghee-making process refined through generations. These recipes aren’t experiments — they are memories wrapped in tradition, ensuring that each bite feels both familiar and special."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Ingredients Sourced With Responsibility",
      "paragraph": "We work directly with small farmers and trusted local suppliers who put integrity above quantity. The grains, spices, oils, and herbs we use are grown with care, without harmful chemicals, and harvested at their natural best. Your food should feel clean, pure, and safe — and that begins right at the farm."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Crafted Slowly, With Intention",
      "paragraph": "We believe good food can’t be rushed. That’s why each mix, each bottle, each packet is crafted slowly, allowing flavors to open up in their own time. Whether it’s slow-cooking, hand-mixing, or patiently roasting, every step is driven by the belief that quality is never accidental — it is deliberate."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Packed By Hand, Delivered With Love",
      "paragraph": "There is something special about receiving food that feels like it was made just for you. Every product is hand-packed in small batches, checked individually, and sealed with care to preserve freshness. When you open a GHAR KA product, we want you to feel like someone prepared it lovingly for your home."
